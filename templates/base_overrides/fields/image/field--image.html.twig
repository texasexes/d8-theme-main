/**

 * Default theme implementation for a text field.
 *
 * A 'clearfix' class is added, because 'text' fields have a 'format' property
 * that allows a Text Format to be associated with the entered text, which then
 * applies filtering on output. A common use case is to align images to the left
 * or right, and without this 'clearfix' class, such aligned images may be
 * rendered outside of the 'text' field formatter's boundaries, and hence
 * overlap with other fields. By setting the 'clearfix' class on all 'text'
 * fields, we prevent that.
 *
 * @see https://www.drupal.org/node/2358529
 *
 * A 'text-formatted' class is added to assist with default styling of base
 * elements such as paragraphs and lists that may not have classes assigned to
 * them. This allows user entered content to have default styling without
 * interfering with the styles of other UI components such as system generated
 * lists or other dynamic content.
